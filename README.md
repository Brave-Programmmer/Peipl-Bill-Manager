## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install
```

### Development

```bash
# Start development server (runs both Vite and Electron)
npm run dev

# Start only Vite dev server
npm run dev:vite

# Start only Electron (requires Vite running)
npm run dev:electron
```

The application will open with:
- Vite dev server on `http://localhost:5173`
- Electron window with hot-reload enabled

### Building

```bash
# Build for production
npm run build
```

This will:
1. Build the React application with Vite
2. Package the Electron app with electron-builder
3. Create an installer in `dist-electron/` directory

### Linting

```bash
# Run ESLint
npm run lint
```

## Usage

2. Fill in customer details or select from presets
3. Add job entries with descriptions, quantities, and rates
4. Tax calculations are automatic
5. Click **Preview & Print** to review
6. Save as JSON file or to local history

### Managing Invoices

- **Dashboard**: View all invoices filtered by financial year
- **History**: Access saved invoices
- **Settings**: Configure company details and scan paths

### GeM Integration

1. Configure GeM PDF scan paths in Settings
2. Dashboard automatically matches invoices with GeM PDFs
3. Toggle GeM upload status manually if needed
4. Track pending uploads in the dashboard

### Print & PDF Export

- Click **Preview & Print** in the invoice editor
- Toggle stamp visibility
- Print directly to printer
- Save as PDF file

## Configuration

### Company Details

## File Formats

### Invoice JSON Structure

```json
{
  "billNumber": "PEIPL/2025/123",
  "date": "2025-01-15",
  "orderNumber": "GEMC-511687712601789",
  "customerName": "Customer Name",
  "plantName": "Plant Name",
  "customerAddress": "Address",
  "customerGST": "27AAACR2831H1ZK",
  "items": [...],
  "taxMode": "GST",
  "totalTaxableValue": 0,
  "totalCGST": 0,
  "totalSGST": 0,
  "totalIGST": 0,
  "grandTotal": 0,
  "amountInWords": "RUPEES ZERO ONLY",
  "status": "draft",
  "gemUploaded": false
}
```

## Architecture

### Electron IPC Communication

The application uses a secure IPC bridge via `contextBridge`:

**Main Process** (`src/electron/main.js`):
- File system operations
- Window management
- Print/PDF generation
- Directory scanning

**Renderer Process**:
- React application
- State management
- UI rendering

**Preload Script** (`src/electron/preload.cjs`):
- Secure IPC bridge
- Exposes safe APIs to renderer

### State Management

Zustand store with localStorage persistence:
- Current invoice
- Invoice history
- Company details
- Customer presets
- Theme preference
- Scan paths

### Print/PDF Implementation

The current print implementation uses a workaround approach. For details on the architecture and recommended improvements, see [PRINT_AND_PDF_APPROACH.md](./PRINT_AND_PDF_APPROACH.md).

## Financial Year Extraction

The application automatically extracts financial years from:
- File paths (e.g., `APRIL 2025` → FY 2425)
- Bill numbers (e.g., `PEIPLCH2526/22` → FY 2526)
- Folder names with month-year patterns

## Build Configuration

### Electron Builder

Configured in `package.json`:
- **App ID**: `com.peipl.bill`
- **Product Name**: `PEIPL BILL`
- **Output**: `dist-electron/`
- **Windows Target**: NSIS installer
- **File Associations**: `.json`, `.peibill`, `.peiinvoice`, `.peiplbill`

### Vite Configuration

Standard React + Vite setup with:
- React plugin
- Hash router for Electron compatibility
- CSS processing with PostCSS

## Development Notes

### Adding New Features

1. Update types in `src/utils/types.ts`
2. Add state to `src/store/useInvoiceStore.ts`
3. Create UI components in `src/components/`
4. Add pages in `src/pages/`
5. Update routing in `src/App.tsx`

### Styling

- Uses Tailwind CSS with custom theme
- CSS variables for theming
- Glass morphism effects
- Responsive design

### Performance

- Virtual scrolling for large lists
- Memoized calculations
- Lazy loading where appropriate
- Efficient re-renders with React 19

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Electron window doesn't open:**
- Ensure Vite dev server is running on port 5173
- Check console for errors

**Print/PDF not working:**
- Verify printer is connected
- Check Electron permissions
- See PRINT_AND_PDF_APPROACH.md for architecture details

**File association not working:**
- Reinstall the application
- Check file extension associations in OS settings
